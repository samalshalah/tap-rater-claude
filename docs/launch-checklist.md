# Tap Rater Launch Checklist

Use this checklist before selling or shipping Tap Rater devices that point to `https://taprater.com/r/{deviceCode}`. It covers QA, security, packaging, and operational checks for the current platform stage.

Stripe checkout is available for test mode only. Live payments, live paid orders, tax, and shipping calculation are intentionally not live yet.

## Smoke Test

Run these commands before each production deployment:

```bash
npm run build
npm test
npm run check:platform-schema
npm run start
```

In another terminal:

```bash
npm run smoke
```

For a deployed target:

```bash
SMOKE_BASE_URL=https://taprater.com npm run smoke
```

The smoke script checks:

- `/`
- `/product/google-review-white-stand`
- `/admin/login`
- `/activate`
- `/r/TR-DEMO-GOOGLE`

`/r/TR-DEMO-GOOGLE` accepts either a rendered page or redirect status because demo behavior can differ between local fallback and configured Supabase environments.

## Amazon Packaging Instructions

- [ ] NFC chip points to `https://taprater.com/r/{deviceCode}`.
- [ ] QR code points to the same permanent URL.
- [ ] Public device code is printed clearly.
- [ ] Private activation code is printed on an insert card or hidden instruction area.
- [ ] Private activation code is not visible in Amazon listing photos.
- [ ] Private activation code is not printed on the outside of retail packaging.
- [ ] Amazon listing copy says basic activation does not require a monthly fee.
- [ ] Amazon listing copy says premium dashboard/hosted features are optional.
- [ ] Insert card explains how to activate:
  - [ ] Tap or scan the stand.
  - [ ] Enter the private activation code.
  - [ ] Enter email, business name, and destination URL.
  - [ ] Save activation.
- [ ] Packaging tells customers to contact Tap Rater support if the private activation code is missing or already used.

## Security Notes

- [ ] Activation code is private and must not be treated like the public device code.
- [ ] Never print real activation codes in Amazon photos, product mockups, public docs, or support screenshots.
- [ ] Store only `activation_code_hash`; never store plain activation codes.
- [ ] Validate redirect URLs before saving or redirecting.

- [ ] Reject unsafe schemes such as `javascript:` and `data:`.
- [ ] Restrict Google Maps keys by website and API.
- [ ] Set Google Maps quotas and billing alerts.
- [ ] Rate limit activation attempts by device, email, and IP hash where practical.
- [ ] Log activation failures without storing raw IP addresses.
- [ ] Keep `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` server-side only.
- [ ] Keep admin and customer session secrets out of the browser.
